# Study Hall: Problem Solving & Function Scope

## 4:15 | quick intro

- name

- up to one sentence: how you're feeling

- optional: something you're confused about

## 4:20 | context

#### 1. "build and burn" = get comfortable starting from scratch

#### 2. SO MANY WAYS to solve; main thing is to find your own process

#### 3. Problem solving tips:

- READ THE ENTIRE README CAREFULLY

- take it one deliverable at a time

- comment your code as you go to remind yourself what each thing does

- each function should do only one thing (ideally)

- functions shouldn't be more than 15 - 20 lines
  
  - shorter is even better (to a point)

- break each deliverable into ***tiny*** steps

- console.log() as you go

- avoid global scope variables
  
  - you can definitely get away with it for now, but it will help you down the road if you break the habit early

## 4:25 | build #1

## 4:45 | burn it; build #2

- "git restore ." will set your code back to the last commit

- "git clean -f" will remove any files you added since the last commit
