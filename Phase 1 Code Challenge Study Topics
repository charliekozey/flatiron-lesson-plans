# Code challenge focus topics

To pass the code challenge, you must be able to demonstrate that you can add functionality to a web page. The HTML and CSS will already be set up for you; all or almost all of your work will be in JavaScript. These are the areas to focus on:

## 1. DOM Manipulation

- add DOM nodes to page or parent node
- remove DOM nodes from page or parent node
- change content of DOM nodes (text or image)
- increment values displayed on DOM nodes (for example, ratings or number of likes)

## 2. Communicating with the server

- retrieve items from a database with a fetch GET request and display them on the page (using the json-server node package)
- access data according to RESTful principles (e.g. "/items" vs "/items/1")

## 3. Event Listeners

- add event listeners that respond to user input and trigger changes in the DOM (such as adding a new element to the page)
- create functional web forms to store (or otherwise use) user input on submit

## 4. General

- manipulate arrays and objects; access the data inside them (may be nested)
- use functions and callback functions; ideally, each function should be reusable, clearly named, and do only one thing
- understand and apply scope

# For additional stretch goals, you should be able to:

- persist changes by sending fetch POST, PATCH, and/or DELETE requests to a simple backend (using the json-server node package)
